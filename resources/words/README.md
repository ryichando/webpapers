List Of English Words
=============

A text file containing over 466k English words.

While searching for a list of english words (for an auto-complete tutorial)
I found: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2213607/how-to-get-english-language-word-database which refers to [http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-list-350000-simple-english-words-excel-readable](https://web.archive.org/web/20131118073324/http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-list-350000-simple-english-words-excel-readable) (archived).

No idea why infochimps put the word list inside an excel (.xls) file.

I pulled out the words into a simple new-line-delimited text file.
Which is more useful when building apps or importing into databases etc.

Copyright still belongs to them.
